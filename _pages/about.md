I obtained my Ph.D. from the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) under its Quantum Engineering Programme Initiative. My research primarily focuses on quantum arithmetic, quantum cryptanalysis, quantum cybersecurity, and quantum computing.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Anupam Chattopadhyay. Additionally, I gained valuable experience working with Prof. Takanori Isobe, Dr. Mostafizar Rahman, and Dr. Ravi Anand during my research internship at the University of Hyogo, Japan.
