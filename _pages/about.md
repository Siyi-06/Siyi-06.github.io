I obtained my Ph.D. from the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) under its Quantum Engineering Programme Initiative. My research primarily focuses on quantum arithmetic, quantum cryptanalysis, quantum cybersecurity, and quantum computing.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Anupam Chattopadhyay. Additionally, I gained valuable experience working with Prof. Takanori Isobe, Dr. Mostafizar Rahman, and Dr. Ravi Anand during my research internship at the University of Hyogo, Japan.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
