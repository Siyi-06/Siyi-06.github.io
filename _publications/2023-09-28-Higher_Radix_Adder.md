excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose an efficient quantum carry-lookahead adder based on the higher radix structure. For the addition of two n-bit numbers, our adder uses O(n) âˆ’ O(n/r) qubits and O(n) + O(n/r) T gates to get the correct answer in O(r) + O(log(n/r)) T-depth , where r is the radix. Quantum carry-lookahead adder has already attracted some attention because of its low T-depth. Our work further reduces the overall cost by introducing a higher radix layer. By analyzing the performance in T-depth, T-count, and qubit count, it is shown that the proposed adder is superior to existing quantum carry-lookahead adders. Even compared to the Draper out-of-place adder which is very compact and efficient, our adder is still better in terms of T-count.'
