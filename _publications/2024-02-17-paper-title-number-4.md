permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose an efficient quantum carry-lookahead adder based on the higher radix structure. For the addition of two n-bit numbers, our adder uses O(n) − O(n/r) qubits and O(n) + O(n/r) T gates to get the correct answer in O(r) + O(log(n/r)) T-depth , where r is the radix. Quantum carry-lookahead adder has already attracted some attention because of its low T-depth. Our work further reduces the overall cost by introducing a higher radix layer. By analyzing the performance in T-depth, T-count, and qubit count, it is shown that the proposed adder is superior to existing quantum carry-lookahead adders. Even compared to the Draper out-of-place adder which is very compact and efficient, our adder is still better in terms of T-count.'

title: "A comprehensive study of quantum arithmetic circuits"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
abstract: 'In recent decades, the field of quantum computing has experienced remarkable progress. This progress is marked by the superior performance of many quantum algorithms compared with their classical counterparts, with Shor’s algorithm serving as a prominent illustration. Quantum arithmetic circuits, which are the fundamental building blocks in numerous quantum algorithms, have attracted much attention. Despite extensive exploration of various designs in the existing literature, researchers remain keen to develop novel designs and improve existing ones. In this review article, we aim to provide a systematically organized and easily comprehensible overview of the current state of the art in quantum arithmetic circuits. Specifically, this study covers fundamental operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modular exponentiation. We delve into the detailed quantum implementations of these prominent designs and evaluate their efficiency considering various objectives. We also discuss potential applications of the presented arithmetic circuits and suggest future research directions.'
