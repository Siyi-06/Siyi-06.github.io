excerpt: 'Quantum computers are set to revolutionize multiple application domains, including financial portfolio optimization, drug discovery, supply chain optimization, and cryptography, by offering algorithmic speed-up over the best-known classical algorithms. This large-scale adoption will also make quantum computers a lucrative target for cyber-criminals. However, to date, there has been minimal experimental study on the possible attack surfaces and the severity of attacks on a real quantum computer. In this work, we introduce MalaQ, a malware specifically developed for quantum computers. MalaQ exploits the classical-computer frontend of a quantum system and causes extensive damages like performance degradation and even complete failure of the quantum circuits. In this paper, we discuss the design, implementation, and experiments using MalaQ in great detail, including drawing parallels with prior works on both classical and quantum cyber-attacks.'
